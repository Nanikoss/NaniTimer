# NaniTimer
Nani Timer is a mod built for Black Ops III with speedrunners in mind\
This mod is made for speedrunners, by speedrunners.

And was initially conceptualized to help with Black Ops III: Moon EE Speedruns\
The initial mod was very well recieved by the community and I realised I could expand the mod much further 
adding support for other maps and other features to make this a great tool for the EE Speedruning community.

## Features
- Ingame timer with attempt counter + splits based on the map your playing 
- Unlimited Gobblegums when playing online/offline
- Options menu for customizing your timer
